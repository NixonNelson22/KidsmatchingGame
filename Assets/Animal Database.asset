  - <Name>k__BackingField: Beetle
    <description>k__BackingField: "Beetles are a group of insects that form the order
      Coleoptera. The word \"coleoptera\" is from the Greek \u03BA\u03BF\u03BB\u03B5\u03CC\u03C2,
      koleos meaning \"sheath\"; and \u03C0\u03C4\u03B5\u03C1\u03CC\u03BD, pteron
      meaning \"wing\", thus \"sheathed wing\", because most beetles have two pairs
      of wings, the front pair, the elytra, being hardened and thickened into a shell-like
      protection for the rear pair and the beetle's abdomen."
